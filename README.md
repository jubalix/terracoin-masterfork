# Development process #

Developers work in their own trees, then submit pull requests when they think
their feature or bug fix is ready.

If it is a simple/trivial/non-controversial change, then one of the
terracoin development team members simply pulls it.

Official Bitcoin patches are also regurlarly merged into Terracoin.

Newly developped features and additions are submitted to **dev-x.y.z** branch,
"x", "y" and "z" (respectively major, minor an build) matching a given Terracoin
milestone at github project page.

When an upcoming milestone is about to be released, code from given "dev-x.y.z"
branch is merged into corresponding "release-x.y.z" branch, for testing.

Upon validation, "release-x.y.z" branch is merged into "master" branch,
tested again, and a new tag is created.

Feature branches ("feature-shortname") may eventually be created when two
or more developpers works on the same task.


Testing
-------

Testing and code review is the bottleneck for development; we get more pull
requests than we can review and test. Please be patient and help out, and
remember this is a security-critical project where any mistake might cost people
lots of money.

### Automated Testing

Developers are strongly encouraged to write unit tests for new code, and to
submit new unit tests for old code.

Unit tests for the core code are in `src/test/`. To compile and run them:

    cd src; make -f makefile.unix test

Unit tests for the GUI code are in `src/qt/test/`. To compile and run them:

Unit tests for the GUI code are in src/qt/test/
To compile and run them:
  qmake TERRACOIN_QT_TEST=1 -o Makefile.test terracoin-qt.pro
  make -f Makefile.test
  ./terracoin-qt_test
